Label connector plugin is the successor of [EasyCustomLabeling](https://github.com/haubourg/EasyCustomLabeling). 

The purpose of this plugin is to simplify the drawing of label connectors, also known as callouts. 

EasyCustom labeling did a copy of the dataset to be labeled into a line memory layer. 
LabelConnector will only take profit of the symbology power of geometry generators and auxiliary data to avoid the data duplication. 

It is a temporary solution for QGIS 3.4 / 3.6 / 3.8. QGIS 3.10 now has the native feature of drawing callouts.
